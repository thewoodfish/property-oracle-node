Property Oracle is a blockchain solution built on <a target="_blank" href="https://substrate.io">substrate</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://kilt.io">kilt</a>,  which empowers you to create an indisputable, irrefutable proof of ownership of your various properties. e.g a plot of land.
With Property Oracle, nobody can take what is yours and leave you with nothing.

# Property Oracle Blockchain Node
This repo contains the code for a typical Property Oracle node participating in the network. The property oracle chain is very important because it records critical information about users of the networks, the properties being secured or claimed, the claims and right to claim of the properties and so on, serving as a source of truth and actions. We would examine the chain properly. A Property Oracle node is completely built on <a target="_blank" href="https://substrate.io">substrate</a> which is the best framework for building a blockchain.

## Examining the `oracle pallet`
Since this chain is build on <a target="_blank" href="https://substrate.io">substrate</a>, it comprises of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.substrate.io/reference/frame-pallets/">pallets</a> which defines the business logic of the chain. We would be considering one very important property oracle pallet: the `oracle pallet`.

### Functions in the `oracle pallet`
- <b>`record_user:`</b>
   ```
   pub fn record_user(origin: OriginFor<T>, cid: Vec<u8>) -> DispatchResult { ... }
   ``` 
This function accepts a `cid` as its input. The `cid` is generated when the `KILT did` document of a user is uploaded to `IPFS`. This `did` document is generated when a user creates an account with Property Oracle because its most certain that the user would be interacting with the <a target="_blank" href="https://kilt.io">`kilt`</a> blockchain in the background. What this function does is to store a mapping of the users `substrate account address` to the users `kilt` `did document` which contains all necessary info of the user.<br>
Once this state change is complete, the `NewUserRecorded` event is generated and visible on the blockchains UI explorer.

- <b>`record_ptype:`</b>
   ```
   pub fn record_ptype(
	origin: OriginFor<T>,
	hash: H256,
	name: Vec<u8>,
	cid: Vec<u8>,
	props: Vec<u8>,
   ) -> DispatchResult { ... } 
   ``` 
This function accepts the `id(hash)` of a property, the name or title of the property document to be filled, the `cid` of the uploaded `KILT chain` `CType` for the property document fields and the required attributes or fields to be filled in a property document.
This function creates a new property document and records it onchain. It also takes note of the registrar of the document. The registrar is important because his signature is the single principal entity to attest a property credential and confer the right meaning of ownership. <br>
Once this state change is complete, the `NewPropertyTypeRecorded` event is generated and visible on the blockchains UI explorer. 

- <b>`record_ptype:`</b>
   ```
   pub fn record_credential(origin: OriginFor<T>, hash: H256, cid: Vec<u8>) -> DispatchResult { ... }
   ``` 
This function accepts the `id(hash)` of a property and the `cid` of the `KILT` credential or claim created of a particular property. This function records the unverified claim to a property and the user or `address` of the claimer, waiting to be verified or approved.
Once this state change is complete, the `NewPropertyCredentialCreated` event is generated and visible on the blockchains UI explorer.


- <b>`transfer_property:`</b>
   ```
   pub fn transfer_property(
	origin: OriginFor<T>,
	recipient: T::AccountId,
	property_id: H256,
	cid: Vec<u8>,
   ) -> DispatchResult { ... } 
   ``` 
This functions accepts the `substrate address` of the recipient, the `id` of the intended property and the `cid` of the `KILT` credential or claim of the property. The functions processes the transfer of a claim to a property (verified or unverified) and changes the owner or claimer to the address of the recipient. This is an important operation as it can help trace the origin and history of the land sale, from hand to hand. <br>
Once this state change is complete, the `PropertyTransferred` event is generated and visible on the blockchains UI explorer.

- <b>`attest_claim:`</b>
   ```
   pub fn attest_claim(
	origin: OriginFor<T>,
	property_id: H256,
	cid: Vec<u8>,
	is_canonical_verifier: bool,
   ) -> DispatchResult { ... } 
   ``` 
   This function accepts the `id` of the property, the `cid` of the `KILT` credential or claim of the property, a `boolean` to determine whether the right authority(the registrar of the property type) is the one attesting or its just one of the many witnesses. What the function does is to record the credential attestation of the property, which signifies witnesses confirming the ownership of the property by the claimer. But because there are many witnesses doesn't enforce the ownership claim of the property, it only helps inform the right authorities that the claimer might just be telling the truth. It is when the authority decides to attest the credential that Property Oracle submits a request to the `KILT` chain to attest the property `credential` and records this action amd its timestamp onchain. When this happens, the claimer can then be called THE OWNER üòÉ.
   Once this function registers a complete state change, the `PropertyClaimAttested` event is generated and visible on the blockchains UI explorer.
   
## Running a local Property Oracle node 
- Install the necessary `Rust toolchains` and configure them. Please take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.substrate.io/install/">this page</a> to guide you appropriately.
- After installation, clone this repository.
- After cloning, open the terminal in the root folder and run the command: `cargo build --release`.
- After your chain is built, run this command to start the chain in development mode: `./target/release/node-template --dev`
- To interact with the chain from the explorer, visit this address in your browser: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944.
- To interact with the Property Oracle front end, you have to set it up first. kindly read through the set up at: https://github.com/thewoodfish/property_oracle#how-to-run-or-test-property-oracle. It is very easy.

## Conclusion
Property Oracle helps secure your properties and removes any worries or stress from the thought/incident of losing what belongs to you. So even though your physical documents are duplicated or falsified by scammers, once you've submited your document using property oracle and gotten the right authority to sign it, üòÅ YOU MY FRIEND, ARE VERY SAFE, FOREVER!

Thank you for your time! ‚ù§Ô∏è
